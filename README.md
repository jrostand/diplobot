# DiploBot

DiploBot is a Ruby-based [Slack](https://slack.com) bot which serves to handle the secret information in a Diplomacy game - namely, the orders phase.

DiploBot also has support for "World News" - a variant wherein during the diplomacy phase, players can submit stories to be displayed publicly in a gazette.

More documentation forthcoming. Probably.
